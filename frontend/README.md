# medical-ai-front-end

This project will implement a medical chatbot. As of now, it serves as an initial version, with functional Register and Log in features, as it is required to have an account in oder to use the website. \
The Home page interface makes it possible to send messages and restore chat history. The chatbot is not implemented yet.\
The user can log out, as well as see and edit account information (username or email). 
User information (username, email, password) as well as the chats are persisted in a MongoDB database.\
All components are written using the React.js library.

For this project to work, the [back-end](https://github.com/ioana-manghiuc/medical-ai-back-end) must be integrated as well.
